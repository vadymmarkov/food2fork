# Food2Fork

The `Food2Fork` iOS app implemented as a part of
[oboarding process](https://github.com/finn-no/ios-handbook/blob/master/ONBOARDING_PROJECT.md)
at [FINN.no](https://github.com/finn-no).

## Usage

```sh
git clone https://github.com/vadymmarkov/food2fork.git food2fork
cd food2fork
pod install
open Food2Fork.xcworkspace
```

**Setup API keys:**

* Sign up for Food2Fork Recipe API: https://www.food2fork.com/about/api
* Copy your API key to `Sources/Constants/APIConfig.swift`:

```swift
let key = "YOUR_API_KEY"
```

## Features

## Architecture

- The app is built using the Model-View-Controller design pattern
- Navigation logic is moved out of view controllers into dedicated `Navigator` objects
- Dependency injection is implemented using factory protocols and `DependencyContainer` class,
which contains all of the app's core utility objects that are directly injected
as dependencies
- The core logic of view controllers is extracted into matching logic controllers,
where each action returns a new state to render as part of a completion handler

## Networking and API

- [Malibu](https://github.com/vadymmarkov/Malibu) library is used as an
abstraction layer for networking
- Images are loaded by `ImageLoader` utility class, which plays the role of
a wrapper around `URLSession` and `URLCache`
- Food2Fork Recipe API documentation: https://www.food2fork.com/about/api
- Note that the Free plan allows only 50 API calls per day
- If you want to mock requests just open `DependencyContainer.swift` and
create `Networking` instance with the same `MockProvider` as for UI and Unit tests

## Persistency

- `CoreData` is used as a persistency layer
- `NSManagedObjectContext` is hidden behind `ReadableStore` and `WritableStore`
protocols for better separation of concerns
- `URLCache` provides a composite in-memory and on-disk cache for images loaded
from network

## Tests

The app is covered by unit and UI tests: 82,18% according to XCode test coverage.
